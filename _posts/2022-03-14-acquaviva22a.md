title: 'Teaching Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences: A summary of lessons
  learned and challenges'
abstract: This paper summarizes some challenges encountered and best practices established
  in several years of teaching Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences at the undergraduate
  and graduate level. I discuss motivations for teaching ML to Physicists, desirable
  properties of pedagogical materials such as accessibility, relevance, and likeness
  to real-world research problems, and give examples of components of teaching units.
