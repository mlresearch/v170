title: 'Using Matchboxes to Teach the Basics of Machine Learning: an Analysis of (Possible)
  Misconceptions'
abstract: The idea of chess-playing matchboxes, conceived by Martin Gardner as early
  as 1962, is becoming more and more relevant in learning materials in the area of
  AI and Machine Learning. Thus, it can be found in a large number of workshops and
  papers as an innovative teaching method to convey the basic ideas of reinforcement
  learning. In this paper the concept and its variations will be presented and the
  advantages of this analog approach will be shown. At the same time, however, the
  limitations of the approach are analyzed and the question of alternatives is raised.
