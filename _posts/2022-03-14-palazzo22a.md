title: 'Teaching Machine Learning in Argentina: the ClusterAI pipeline'
abstract: Teaching machine learning has been a growing activity in almost any educational
  establishment. Despite the high availability on study materials, Latin America region
  has seen a lack of educational programs focused on machine learning. Additionally
  the majority of educational materials are available only in English. In this work
  we propose the ClusterAI pipeline based on a curated list of topics in Spanish and
  a collaboration with the Buenos Aires city government that open public data-sets
  that let students to apply machine learning models on real data.
