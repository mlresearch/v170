title: Participatory Live Coding and Learning-Centered Assessment in Programming for
  Data Science
abstract: Programming for Data Science is a programming intensive data science course.
  This paper discusses a revision of the course to center student learning. The revision
  effort centered the desired learning outcomes and resulted in a course that charted
  an explicit path toward achieving them for students. This paper summarizes the design
  overall and provides practical details about the instruction via participatory live
  coding and assessment with a competency based grading scheme.
