title: Experiences from Teaching Practical Machine Learning Courses to Master’s Students
  with Mixed Backgrounds
abstract: Machine learning education has become more accessible and relevant to students
  from various backgrounds. Practical courses complement theoretical lectures by focusing
  on applied machine learning. In this work, we report about our experiences from
  teaching two machine learning practical courses to master students from different
  study programs; an introductory and an advanced course. We present a summary of
  the teaching and evaluation methods used in both courses. We summarize our experiences
  and the feedback collected from the students through a survey. We conclude with
  our recommendations on teaching and designing practical machine learning courses.
