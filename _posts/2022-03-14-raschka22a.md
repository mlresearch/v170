title: 'Deeper Learning By Doing: Integrating Hands-On Research Projects Into A Machine
  Learning Course'
abstract: Machine learning has seen a vast increase of interest in recent years, along
  with an abundance of learning resources. While conventional lectures provide students
  with important information and knowledge, we also believe that additional project-based
  learning components can motivate students to engage in topics more deeply. In addition
  to incorporating project-based learning in our courses, we aim to develop project-based
  learning components aligned with real-world tasks, including experimental design
  and execution, report writing, oral presentation, and peer-reviewing. This paper
  describes the organization of our project-based machine learning courses with a
  particular emphasis on the class project components and shares our resources with
  instructors who would like to include similar elements in their courses.
