title: Teaching Deep Learning, a boisterous ever-evolving field
abstract: Machine and deep learning techniques are actively being developed with over
  150 papers submitted daily to arXiv, each of which is introducing its own notation.
  To offer a course that reflects the latest developments of the field and illustrate
  them in a cohesive and consistent manner, one needs to systematically consume the
  literature, summarise and standardise it, implement working examples, and deliver
  a concise and consistent presentation of a given topic. This paper reports all the
  best practices developed by the author in their last decade of teaching experience.
