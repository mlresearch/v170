title: Staying Ahead in the MOOC-Era by Teaching Innovative AI Courses
abstract: 'As a result of the rapidly advancing digital transformation of teaching,
  universities have started to face major competition from Massive Open Online Courses
  (MOOCs). Universities thus have to set themselves apart from MOOCs in order to justify
  the added value of three to five-year degree programs to prospective students. In
  this paper, we show how we address this challenge at Deggendorf Institute of Technology
  in ML and AI. We first share our best practices and present two concrete courses
  including their unique selling propositions: Computer Vision and Innovation Management
  for AI. We then demonstrate how these courses contribute to Deggendorf Institute
  of Technologyâ€™s ability to differentiate itself from MOOCs (and other universities).'
