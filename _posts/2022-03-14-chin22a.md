title: Putting the "Machine" Back in Machine Learning for Engineering Students
abstract: Computer hardware architecture has played an important role in the recent
  advances made in deep learning and associated applications. However, effective teaching
  strategies for hardware architectures for machine learning require a different structure
  and technical background than classic machine learning. More specifically, not only
  does the material need to convey necessary machine learning concepts to students,
  but also covers the hardware and software infrastructure concepts required for supporting
  machine learning systems. In this paper, we describe our approach to designing the
  course materials along with student assessment and evaluation for the “Hardware
  Architectures for Machine Learning” course targeting Electrical and Computer Engineering
  graduate students.
