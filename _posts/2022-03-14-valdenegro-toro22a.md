title: Teaching Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning through Use Cases
abstract: Uncertainty in machine learning is not generally taught as general knowledge
  in Machine Learning course curricula. In this paper we propose a short curriculum
  for a course about uncertainty in machine learning, and complement the course with
  a selection of use cases, aimed to trigger discussion and let students play with
  the concepts of uncertainty in a programming setting. Our use cases cover the concept
  of output uncertainty, Bayesian neural networks and weight distributions, sources
  of uncertainty, and out of distribution detection. We expect that this curriculum
  and set of use cases motivates the community to adopt these important concepts into
  courses for safety in AI.
