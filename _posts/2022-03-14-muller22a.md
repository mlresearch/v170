title: A lesson for teaching fundamental Machine Learning concepts and skills to molecular
  biologists
abstract: Machine Learning represents an invaluable set of tools for the analysis
  of data in molecular biology as well as bio-medicine. Here we present an training
  approach to teach fundamental machine learning skills to researchers in their early
  career stage (PhD and postdoc level) with the aim to empower them to apply these
  methods in their own research projects. The content was developed for being delivered
  in a short and intense learning period as part of a remote systems biology workshop
  but can be adapted to other scenarios with a less restricted time frame.
