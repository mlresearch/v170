title: Teaching machine learning through end-to-end decision making
abstract: Advances in machine learning and data science hold the potential to greatly
  optimize the overall energy sector, and prevent the worst outcomes of anthropogenic
  climate change. However, despite the urgent need for trained energy data scientists
  and the presence of a number of technically challenging issues that need to be tackled,
  the sector continues to suffer from a personnel shortage and remains mired in outdated
  technology. In many programs, energy engineers continue to graduate without even
  rudimentary programming skills, let alone knowledge of data science. This paper
  highlights key findings from an introductory course on machine learning and optimization
  designed specifically for energy engineering students. The course employs a number
  of teaching aids, which we hope will be useful for the broader community as well.
  The course was developed in a pan-European setting, supported by four different
  European universities as part of a broader roadmap to overhaul energy education.
