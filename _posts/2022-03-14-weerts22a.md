title: Teaching Responsible Machine Learning to Engineers
abstract: With the increasing application of machine learning models in practice,
  there is a growing need to incorporate ethical considerations in engineering curricula.
  In this paper, we reflect upon the development of a course on responsible machine
  learning for undergraduate engineering students. We found that technical material
  was relatively easy to grasp when it was directly linked to prior knowledge on machine
  learning. However, it was non-trivial for engineering students to make a deeper
  connection between real-world outcomes and ethical considerations such as fairness.
  Moving forward, we call upon educators to focus on the development of realistic
  case studies that invite students to interrogate the role of an engineer.
