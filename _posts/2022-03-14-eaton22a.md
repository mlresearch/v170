title: Teaching Machine Learning in the Context of Critical Quantitative Information
  Literacy
abstract: Bates College, is a small liberal arts postsecondary institution in the
  northeast United States. An information literacy course, Calling Bull, serves as
  an introductory data science class as well as a prerequisite-free quantitative literacy
  class. In this context, we spend a week discussing machine learning, with an emphasis
  on facial recognition algorithms. The emphasis is on the general algorithmic approach,
  critical inquiry of the process and careful interpretation of results presented
  in research or decision-making. This module relies on the use of open educational
  materials, discussion, and careful attention to issues of marginalization and algorithmic
  justice.
