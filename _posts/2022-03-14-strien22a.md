title: An Introduction to AI for GLAM
abstract: There is a growing interest in utilising Machine Learning (ML) techniques
  within Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM), and a corresponding demand
  for training to enable practitioners to engage confidently in this area. Staff at
  these institutions are seeking practical knowledge and skills in ML concepts and
  methods specific to the sectorâ€™s work, such as in the curation and collection of
  heritage collections. In this paper, we discuss the motivations and methods behind
  "An Introduction to AI for GLAM" a new Carpentries workshop under development through
  an international partnership between British Library, Smithsonian Institution, and
  The National Archives UK. This new workshop aims to introduce GLAM practitioners
  to the essential conceptual and practical considerations for supporting, participating
  in and undertaking machine learning-based research and projects within the GLAM
  sector.
