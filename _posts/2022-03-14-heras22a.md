title: 'Deep Learning Projects from a Regional Council: An Experience Report'
abstract: Due to the impact of Deep Learning both in industry and academia, there
  is a growing demand of graduates with skills in this field, and Universities are
  starting to offer courses that include Deep Learning subjects. Hands-on assignments
  that teach students how to tackle Deep Learning tasks are an instrumental part of
  those courses. However, most Deep Learning assignments have two main drawbacks.
  First, they use either toy datasets, that are useful to teach concepts but whose
  solutions do not generalise to real problems, or employ datasets that require specialised
  knowledge to fully understand the problem. Secondly, most Deep Learning assignments
  are focused on training a model, and do not take into account other stages of the
  Deep Learning pipeline, such as data cleaning or model deployment. In this work,
  we present an experience in an Artificial Intelligence course where we have tackled
  the aforementioned drawbacks by using datasets from the regional council where our
  University is located. Namely, the students of the course have developed several
  computer vision and natural language processing projects; for instance, a news classifier
  or an application to colourise historical images. We share the workflow followed
  to organise this experience, several lessons that we have learned, and challenges
  that can be faced by other instructors that try to conduct a similar initiative.
